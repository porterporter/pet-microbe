# *Trichoderma harzianum*

In **PLPATH123**, my pet microbe was *Trichoderma harzianum*

Over the course of a few weeks, I performed *3* experiments to get to know my microbe better.

## [Experiment #1](./experiments/1)
In which temperature climate does *T. harzianum* grow best?\
I created 6 petri's in three environments and recorded which one had the most radial growth.

## [Experiment #2](./experiments/2)
When placed in a petri with Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, is *T. harzianum* able to fend off the competition?

## [Experiment #3](./experiments/3)
When innoculated into a soybean plant, can *T. harzianum* prevent Sclerotinia sclerotiorum from killing the host?
