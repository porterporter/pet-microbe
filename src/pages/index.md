# *Trichoderma harzianum*

In **PLPATH123**, my pet microbe was *Trichoderma harzianum*

*Trichoderma harzianum* is a filamentous fungi found most often in soil and plant root environments. Outside the lab, it is recognized for its biocontrol properties and plant growth promotion. *T. harzianum* can outcompete harmful microbes without the need for traditional fungicides, similar to how Bacillus thuringiensis can keep plants safe from pests without the need for pesticides.

*T. harzianum* is also used in environmental and sustainability fields. It can degrade pollutants like pesticides and heavy metals from soils and water, making it really useful for soil resteration and bioremediation. By improving soil health and overall fertility, *T. harzianum* contributes to increased carbon sequestration, slowing global warming.

In my experiments, I wanted to find the ideal conditions for growing *T. harzianum* and see if it could fend off the competition from *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum*, a common pathogen in soybean plants. Growing my microbe was easy, usually on a week-by-week basis, I would take a sample from an old petri dish and place it in a new one (PDA). This would allow the microbe to continue to grow by adding fresh nutrients.

Over the course of a few weeks, I performed *3* experiments to get to know my microbe better.

## [Experiment #1](./experiments/1)
In which temperature climate does *T. harzianum* grow best?\
I created 6 petri's in three environments and recorded which one had the most radial growth.

## [Experiment #2](./experiments/2)
When placed in a petri with *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum*, is *T. harzianum* able to fend off the competition?

## [Experiment #3](./experiments/3)
When inoculated into a soybean plant, can *T. harzianum* prevent *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum* from killing the host?

**Peer Experiment**

Together with Nina, we brainstormed ideas for her experiment. For ensuring consistent results, we decided to use PDA plates in her humidity experiments. In her experiment, she found that low humidity levels were the best for *Fusarium graminearum* growth. *We didn't have the same microbe in the project, so I can't compare results though.*
