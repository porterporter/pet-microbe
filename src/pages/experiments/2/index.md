title: T. harzianum's interaction with S. sclerotiorum in a petri dish
---

# Experiment #2: Growth of *Trichoderma harzianum* in a Petri dish with *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum*
> Hypothesis: T. harzianum will suppress the growth of white mold inside a Petri dish.

## Experiment
Prepare 6 Petri dishes. For this experiment, I used Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) plates because it was what my lab had available. In four of the dishes, take a sample from a pure culture of *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum* and place it in the new dishes. In the other two dishes as well as two with *S. sclerotiorum*, take a sample from a pure culture of *Trichoderma harzianum* and place it in the new dishes. Do your best to keep the samples *around* the same area for more consistent results.

### Control
For this experiment, I'll grow two plates with only *S. sclerotiorum* and another two plates with only *T. harzianum*. 

### Treatments
I'll grow two plates with *S. sclerotiorum* and *T. harzianum* together. Later, I can can compare the growth of *S. sclerotiorum* in the presence of *T. harzianum* to the growth of *S. sclerotiorum* and *T. harzianum* alone.

These plates were left at room temperature (~21 Â°C) for 6 days.

## Results
Upon inspection, there were unexpected growths in the *T. harzianum* plates. The *S. sclerotiorum* plates grew normally, but the *T. harzianum* plates had a lot of contamination. In the plates with both *S. sclerotiorum* and *T. harzianum* there were still results to be taken.

These grew as expected. The *S. sclerotiorum* plates grew normally, with a lot of white mycelium.

These plates had a lot of contamination. I think that the *T. harzianum* was not able to grow because it was contaminated with other fungi. Redoing this experiment with a more sterile environment would be a good idea.

In the first plate, there is a noticable slow of growth of *S. sclerotiorum* in the presence of *T. harzianum*. The second plate shows a similar result, but had too much condensation to take a good picture.

## Conclusion
Unfortunately, this experiment was not very successful. The *T. harzianum* plates were contaminated and I was not able to get a good picture of the interaction between *S. sclerotiorum* and *T. harzianum*. However, I did see that there was a slow of growth of *S. sclerotiorum* in the presence of *T. harzianum*. This is a good sign that *T. harzianum* is able to fend off the competition. Going forward, I would like to repeat this experiment with a more sterile environment to get better results. I think fresher *T. harzianum* would also encourage more rapid growth when plated alone. I would also like to try this experiment with other fungi to see if *T. harzianum* is able to fend off other competitors.
