title: T. harzianum's interaction with S. sclerotiorum in a petri dish
---

# Experiment #3: Growth of *Trichoderma harzianum* on a soybean host with *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum*
> Hypothesis: T. harzianum will reduce the severity of S. sclerotiorum infection in soybean
Seedlings.

## Experiment
Prepare 6 Soybean seedlings. Wrap 2x seedlings with *S. sclerotiorum* and 2x seedlings with both *S. sclerotiorum* and *T. harzianum*. Leave the last 2x seedlings as a control.

### Control
In this experiment, the seedlings with no fungi will be the control. This will allow me to compare the growth of the seedlings with *S. sclerotiorum* and *T. harzianum* to the growth of the seedlings without any fungi.

### Treatments
1. Soybeans inoculated with *S. sclerotiorum*
2. Soybeans inoculated with *S. sclerotiorum* and *T. harzianum*

Plants are inoculated by taking a sample of the fungi, and wrapping it around the base of the plant using parafilm. The plants were left in a grow chamber for 6 days.

## Conclusion
This experiment was also inconclusive. The plants with *S. sclerotiorum* and *T. harzianum* had less discoloration than the plants with only *S. sclerotiorum*, but not enough to reach any conclusion. The control plants had slight natural discoloration, but not enough to be concerned about. I was not able to decern if *T. harzianum* had any effect in reducing the severity of *S. sclerotiorum* (white mold) in a soybean host. In future experiments, I would...
1. Use a larger sample size
2. Inoculate earlier in the growth cycle
3. Attach the fungi to the roots of the plants
4. Use a different method of inoculation
