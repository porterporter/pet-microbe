title: T. harzianum's interaction with S. sclerotiorum in a petri dish
---

# Experiment #3: Growth of *Trichoderma harzianum* on a soybean host with *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum*
> Hypothesis: T. harzianum will reduce the severity of S. sclerotiorum infection in soybean
Seedlings.

## Experiment
Prepare 6 Soybean seedlings. Wrap 2x seedlings with *S. sclerotiorum* and 2x seedlings with both *S. sclerotiorum* and *T. harzianum*. Leave the last 2x seedlings as a control.

### Control
In this experiment, the seedlings with no fungi will be the control. This will allow me to compare the growth of the seedlings with *S. sclerotiorum* and *T. harzianum* to the growth of the seedlings without any fungi.

### Treatments
1. Soybeans innoculated with *S. sclerotiorum*
2. Soybeans innoculated with *S. sclerotiorum* and *T. harzianum*

The plants were left in a grow chamber for 6 days.
