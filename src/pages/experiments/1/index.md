title: T. harzianum's growth in different temperatures
---

# Experiment #1: Growth of *Trichoderma harzianum* at different temperature.
> Hypothesis: Raising ambient temperature will increase the growth rate of *Trichoderma harzianum* due to its preference for warm conditions.

## Experiment
Prepare 6 Petri dishes. For this experiment, I used Nutrient Agar (NA) plates because it was what my lab had available. In each of the dishes, take a sample from a pure culture of *Trichoderma harzianum* and place it in the new dishes. Do your best to keep the samples *around* the same area for more consistent results.

### Control
For this experiment, I'll grow *T. harzianum* at room temperature (~21 °C) because it is the temperature at which I usually keep my cultures at. I will also use this temperature as a control for the other two treatments.

### Treatments
1. 4 °C (fridge)
2. 37 °C (incubator)

I placed 2 dishes in each of the three environments. I made sure to label the dishes so I could keep track of which was which.

*My prepared petri dishes*

I placed 2 dishes in the fridge at 4 °C, 2 dishes in the lab at room temperature (~21 °C), and 2 dishes in an incubator at 37 °C. I made sure to label the dishes so I could keep track of which was which.

I left this petri dishes to grow for 4 days. After a week, *T. harzianum* can already reach the edge in some cases, so I thought it would be best to take results before then. Results were recorded by measuring the diameter of the colony in millimeters. I took two measurements per dish and averaged them.

## Results
|Temperature | Growth (mm) |
|------------|-------------|
| 4 °C     | 16 (no growth)           |
| 4 °C     | 18 (no growth)           |
| ~21 °C  (room temperature)   | 85 (whole dish)           |
| ~21 °C  (room temperature)   | 85 (whole dish)           |
| 37 °C     | 62           |
| 37 °C     | 75           |

## Conclusion
The results of this experiment were not what I expected. I thought that *T. harzianum* would grow best at 37 °C, but it actually grew best at room temperature. The growth at 4 °C was almost non-existent, which is what I expected.

I think that the results of this experiment are consistent with the hypothesis, but I would like to repeat it with a larger sample size and more temperature points. I would also like to try using different media, such as potato dextrose agar (PDA) to see if that has an effect on the growth rate.
